            "description": "I help people turn their creative imaginations into wearable art. Working with customers I create unique jewelry in sterling silver and 14k gold filled, allowing them to enhance their own beauty with high quality, professional jewelry pieces that will last for years.  Creating jewelry is a personal thing for me. Through my jewelry a part of me is exposed. My father was my mentor and a perfectionist. He would sooner throw a piece out then let a less than perfect project leave his studio. The challenge becomes balancing customers ideas with an eye for art and beauty. I relish the opportunity to give something real, made by my own hand, a piece of myself, to a customer and in so doing forever connect us in a way nothing else could.",

Our mission is to create one of kind pieces  for the chic, fearless, trendsetting individuals: vagabonds of fashion who refuse to follow the crowd and set their own personal style. We do not mass produce any of our garments. Everything is made from a small production in the U.S. using materials found at Americas wastelands. Each garment is made individually for you from vintage fabrics. We bring exclusivity to your wardrobe. So when your friend  says ”I want one just like that!” you can kindly say…… Sorry, I'm the only one that owns this.",

High vibration fashion is woven with love and magic in each and EVERY piece. You can feel the vibrational difference when you put on one of my garments. There is a distinct difference when you wear pieces that are made by people in a high vibe healthy setting vs. items that were made in a sweat shop child labor factory. New to Triluna in 2015 is the Triluna Apothecary line. From potions that are made for magical purposes to balms and baths that are made to shift your state of mind and the energy around you, Triluna Apothecary is there to assist with meditation, protection, love and all of the above.",

Funds are also used to assist in bringing visiting printmakers to the department.

Listening to radio is a great way to satisfy your passion for music, while learning something about the music along the way. The best music radio presenters are ones who share their passion with you, and take you on a musical journey every time they open the mic. Each KRCL DJ is a curator, a trusted guide.  KRCL DJs play music you know and love, and surprise you with the occasional song you don’t know or haven’t heard in a long time.  It’s the knowledge and context the DJ brings to his or her show that makes listening to KRCL special and the little stories, anecdotes and bits of information that are peppered throughout  that make it a great listen. While the avenues for music discovery are multiplying, there is an inherent value in KRCL’s brand of radio. KRCL DJs are human beings doing something that an algorithm alone could not do – identifying all kinds of genres, a huge variety of styles and songs, some obscured or out of print, and putting them together in a way that makes sense and touches you emotionally.",

Since then she's started making her own designs, taking on commissions, and is excited to bring her products to the Salt Lake community! Her embroidery is inspired by nature, vintage designs, illuminated manuscripts, typography, maps, and the space and boundaries we use to divide and delineate our physical lives.

Originally, he owned a recording studio, but became increasingly dissatisfied by the inadequacies of the equipment.

Since then, fine-tuning custom amps by ear has been a passion for Stippich. He is a self-taught metal worker, who received a lot of guidance as well as tools from his step-father, a sculptor, to perfect the streamlined art deco design of all his amps and pre-amps. Stippich earned the top Craftsman Award from the Vacuum State of the Art Conference (VSAC) in September 2001. At the conference, Stippich met up with speaker manufacturers Terry and Leslie Cain of the Cain &amp; Cain company, who have championed his products ever since. Electron Luv has grown from a home experiment into a full-fledged company with a worldwide market, with tube enthusiasts from as far away as Thailand buying his equipment. The native Utahn will remain committed to his traditional recipe for success - painstaking attention to detail and craftsmanship - to achieve quality sound.",

They moved to Salt Lake City this year and began adding additional products like lip balm, bath salts, and lotion. Only natural ingredients are used such as coconut oil, hemp oil, shea butter, and coco butter. They are excited to give people the option of holistic remedies and research each essential oil used to make customers aware of it's health benefits.

I have heard about many nights at Bill and Nada’s,  or how they went to Snelgrove’s,when they were kids, and not to mention the MANY, MANY misadventures at Coachman’s and Bar-X.

            "description": "As a child, I loved jewelry, and especially rings. Not just any rings, but the giant, flashy, over the top rings that you can see on someone's finger from twenty feet away. That love of jewelry prompted me to take a metal art/jewelry making class in high school. The teacher challenged the class to create a project using common household items. I coupled that challenge with a piece of my mother's vintage silverware, and made my first spoon ring. That class is where the original inspiration for Silverwear Jewelry SLC began. Fast forward to the present, in addition to refining my metal working skills and learning a lot more about the subtle differences in silverware patterns, I have continued to expand on the original concept, adding; bracelets, earrings, pendants, key chains, wind chimes, vases, hooks, and most recently, a Silverwear Jewelry SLC original, the bicycle rider pendant, to the list of items that I hand make. All of the items mentioned above can be made on site at my booth, using vintage silverplated silverware and basic hand tools consisting of; bolt cutters, files, sandpaper, mandrels, a vise, and a hammer. With an ever changing inventory of over 1000 pieces of silverware (ranging in date from 1800's to 1960's) to choose from, customers can pick a pattern that fits their personality, and watch as I make the piece to their specific size and style in less than 10 minutes. Every piece of jewelry is unique and comes with a DIY demonstration, absolutely free. In addition to the satisfaction I get from creating new and unique pieces of art, I believe that a large part of my success, as well as some of my inspiration can be attributed to the positive feelings people get from being able to choose a specific piece of silverware that they connect with, and then watch as I transform the spoon or fork into a piece of beautiful jewelry. The kind words, positive feedback, friendships made, and overwhelming support that I have received is further inspiration, as well as an affirmation that I am doing exactly what I am supposed to be doing.",

            "description": "My name is Mark Jones, I'm 21 years old and I am a ceramic artist. There is something remarkable in the act of making unique artwork out of raw earth materials, which alone would be considered little more than just dirt. Using methods we as humans have perfected for thousands of years. I found my personal passion for ceramics about four years ago, in my junior year in high school. Ever since then I have done my best to expand my knowledge, and talents within the craft. I find myself so drawn pottery simply for its versatility, there are endless varieties of techniques and styles of pottery to experiment with that it is virtually impossible to become bored with the subject. This will be my first time putting my work out on the market, and I am extremely excited for the opportunity to do so.",

My shop name You Doll Design is a play off my maiden name, Udall, which is pronounced the same. I started taking art classes at a young age and continued that passion as recreation into my adulthood. It wasn’t until I was expecting my second child in 2012 however that I took up calligraphy and subsequently decided to make art and hand lettering my business as well as my hobby. I specialize with watercolor but I am comfortable with several types of artistic media (including pencil, calligraphy pen and ink and acrylics) as well as tackling a variety of subject matter. I like to think that my artwork evokes a whimsy that is distinct to my designs while offering an array of styles universal enough to fit well into almost anyone's design aesthetic. I choose subject matter meant to uplift and inspire and hopefully add a little love and beauty to someone's space.",

They are contributing photographers at Brighton Resort under the alias of Brigtown Chronicles. They also collaborate, under the name Ban Supply Co, in wood cut pieces. The “wood cut poster art” as they call it started when they began to experiment with old photographs and woodcutting. They began collaborating three years ago and have further developed their concepts. They like to keep the subject matter light and fun. Both are avid mountain bikers, snowboarders and skateboarders, also influenced by art and midcentury design. Their hope is further explore these interests and integrate them into their wood cuts and designs. They work as a team on the design and layout. Nate illustrates everything by hand and Bree does the wood cutting. They specialize in vintage pieces. They make various signage, poster art, custom pieces and small furniture. They established a working relationship with Uinta Brewing to reproduce their beer labels in Ban's wood cut style, as well as design the seasonal Brighton IPA logo. Bree and Nate are always looking for opportunities to challenge their wood cut designs and abilities. It is important to them as lovers of the outdoors and arts to keep their work interesting, inspiring and uplifting.",

            "description": "I have been baking sugar cookies for as long as I can remember.  While living in Texas a few years back, I took a cake decorating class and discovered that I could use similar decorating techniques on my cookies.  I have always been somewhat of an artist, dabbling in pencil, watercolor, and oils - and this new edible art medium became an exciting hobby.  I started blogging about my creations, and sharing them at my kids birthday parties…when people started to say, “You should sell these!” I opened an Etsy shop in 2010, which is still currently in operation, and continue to have a steady stream of orders as well as return customers.  I have provided cookies for birthday parties, weddings, bridal showers, baby showers, school auctions, fundraisers, in addition to gifts and seasonal items.  I have also taught basic cookie decorating to small groups.  I have received praise for my cookies, not only for their appearance but also their taste. I moved to Salt Lake City from the Philadelphia area in the summer of 2014.  I would love to share my cookies on a more local level, as well as teach decorating classes.  I love the arts and crafts scene here, I believe that participating in local art shows and boutiques will help me achieve this goal.",

Though she spent some of her formative years among the lakes and woods of Minnesota and western towns of Wyoming, she has spent the majority of her life nestled in the Rocky Mountains of Utah. Her interest in design started when Esther’s sister taught her the colors of the rainbow using a plush toy. As a child, she decorated common objects to make them pretty and give to friends and family. She remembers warm afternoons sprawled out on the grass and sidewalks coloring with friends. From back-of-the-math-test drawings, Esther graduated to studying graphic design in college. Sweet on the surface; silly, quirky, and sassy on the inside, her work reflects that personality. She adores all things springtime, which shows in her work through subject and color. Esther’s ambition is to add delight to your day and home by Making ordinary things pretty.™ In addition to running an online stationery shop, Esther is cutting her teeth in art licensing. Her first licensed patterns are exclusively available from Shibumi Home. She plans to expand further into art licensing, decorating as many surfaces as her heart can dream of.",

While recognizably capturing the goings-on of their societies, they began the tradition of abstraction, where an object is formally defined.  When viewed, these artifacts possess a curious ambiguity due to the removal of context created by the passage of time.  I use representational figures in the same way:  as vehicles through which to study color and line while referencing the world they depict.  I begin with a sanded layer of National Geographic pages that lay a foundation rich with texture and subdued colors.  Next, I build a framework of geometric and organic line that both organizes the texture and provides a skeletal structure to support the culminating coat.  Washes of acrylic paint build to produce a matrix of collaborating colors, while the varying transparency ties all three layers together in contrasting depth.",

After many long nights of researching, sewing and experimenting Velo City Bags was born in 2008. I make the designs, cut out the patterns, and saw every bag by hand. Made vegan, by vegans.",

As an entrepreneur I've done everything from building a freestanding forty foot communications tower out of a pile of angle iron, to creating a throw-able wireless microphone for audience participation. What I love about Makers and DIY'ers is that instead of wishing someone would make that one thing that would make our lives easier in some way, we get our hands dirty and make it ourselves!",

Marla Love continues her generational family tradition of creating sugar skulls and folkloric art for Dia de Muertos, Day of the Dead. Marla Love is involved in many local festivals highlighting her talents and passion for continuing the traditions of the festive holiday; Living Traditions, Foster Care Chalk Festival, Thanksgiving Point &amp; Utah Cultural Celebration Center’s Day of the Dead Celebrations. Year round her family and Marla prepare with traditional sugar skulls, frosting to decorate and sculpting altars for the offering. Year round Marla teaches art in Español in Spanish through ArtFirst ArtePrimero. From pre Columbian times, El Día de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead has been celebrated in Mexico, and other Latin countries. This is a very special ritual, since it is the day in which the living remember their departed relatives.  Sometimes, when people of other cultures hear for the first time about the celebration of the Day of the Dead, they mistakenly think it must be: gruesome, terrifying, scary, ugly and sad. Nothing further from the truth, Day of the Dead is a beautiful ritual in which Mexicans happily and lovingly remember their loved relatives that have died.  Much like when we go to a graveyard to leave some lovely flowers on a tomb of a relative. To many not just the Latin American community, Day of the Dead is an important time to celebrate those loved ones who have passed away.",

            "description": "As an artist, I'm drawn to the play of negative spaces against positive spaces.  As a photographer, I'm drawn to the possibilities of light and light shaping.  As Sociologist, I'm drawn to the human condition and the role it plays.  As a human, I'm drawn to how deeply emotional we all are, but how easily we forget.  I am hugely influenced from artists and photographers from the 40's and 50's.  Their passion, emotion, and emphasis on dramatic lighting speaks deeply to me. When working on a project I may have pre-conceived ideas of how it might turn out, but look forward to elements of surprise that a person, place, or time can have and allow the idea to come to a life of its own.  Challenges allow me to re-evaluate what I'm doing and stretch my skills into new areas. My work focuses on people and my strength focuses on individuals.  I enjoy pulling emotions out of people that are genuine and sincere.  With my recent work with film and wet plate, I have enjoyed the stillness and solitude this has provided the subject and requires them to stretch beyond themselves as well. I utilize various mediums and format in my artwork and am always pushing myself to learn new skills.  Moving back to film has allowed me to slow down and be more thoughtful.  Learning wet plate and cyanotype printing gives me the satisfaction of hand crafting a piece of art from start to finish. My goal is simple to produce work that will stand the test of time not only physically, but keep people coming back and rediscovering the art anew time and time again.",

I learned a lot from my mother in my early years, and then I had wonderful encouraging teachers through out my adolescents. I was then able to pursue my dream of Culinary School, which helped my truly realize my passion for preparing beautiful, tasty food. Being able to be apart of so many happy celebrations wether elaborate or simple saturday morning outings, brings me such joy. I love to see reactions of pure delight from my customers.I use the highest of quality ingredients, including local growers/ millers/ farmers to produce my pastries.  I truly believe that doing what you love shows (and in my case tastes) in your end product.  I love what I do simple as that and i LOVE sharing it with those around me.",

Then she forgot all about it for twenty years until she joined a local Stitch &amp; Bitch group. Marie became The Cotton Floozy and the group became The Happy Valley Crafters. Currently, the Happy Valley Crafters include: The Socially Awkward Stitcher, The Vintage Stitcher, and Dame Toadstool. Each member of the group stitches in her own unique way, creating needle works that are handmade with much love and gentle swearing.
